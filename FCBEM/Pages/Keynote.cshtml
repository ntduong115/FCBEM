    <h3>A New Paradigm for the Internationalisation of New Ventures</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        In former times, multinationals engaged in international business while small businesses tended to focus on
        their local markets. Competition in international markets was traditionally the realm of established companies,
        with newer businesses remaining local or regional in scope. Today, technology and regulatory changes allow new
        ventures to internationalise from inception, and an increasingly successful strategy is that of symbiosis
        between large and small firms operating in networks.

    <h3>Achieving Sustainable Development Goals through Innovation and Human Resource Management</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        Innovation is the engine for the economic and, increasingly, social development of nation states. In recent
        decades, innovation is not only seen as the key to the economic competitiveness of nation states and firms, but
        also as an important mechanism to address grand challenges such as public health, environmental issues and
        poverty reduction. Innovation systems play an important role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable
        Development Goal (SDG). This presentation examines how innovation can contribute to achieving SDGs through human
        resource management (HRM) strategy, policy and practice. It argues that to achieve the SDGs, firms’ innovation
        needs to be human-centred and provides examples to illustrate how this can be accomplished. The presentation
        highlights that SDGs are interconnected and interdependent; the achievement of one may be contingent upon other
        SDGs as well as contributing to the achievement of other SDGs, but it requires stakeholders’ collective efforts
        at all levels.
